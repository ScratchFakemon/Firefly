# Drivers
### Adding more support to Firefly
Drivers for Firefly and Lightning will be in this folder.

Firefly's drivers can allow you to run more apps or do all sorts of other things.

(Firefly's drivers can be installed the same way apps can.)
Below, I have instructions for two ways to install Firefly drivers.


# To download:
```
Open the file for the driver you want to install.
Click the Raw button.
Wait for the file to download.
Go into Firefly.
Open Store.
Select File as your installation method.
Import the file you just downloaded.
```

# To paste link:
```
Open the file for the driver you want to install.
Right-click (Windows), two-finger-click (Universal), alt-click (ChromeOS) or ctrl-click (macOS) the Raw button
Click Copy Link Address.
Paste the link into your URL bar, but don't press enter.
Replace "github.com" with "raw.githubusercontent.com".
Remove "/raw" from the URL.
Copy the link.
Go into Firefly.
Open Store.
Select URL as your installation method.
Paste the link you just copied.
```
