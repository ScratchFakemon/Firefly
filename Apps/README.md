# Apps
### The hub for Firefly Apps 
Apps for Firefly and Lightning will be in this folder.

Firefly apps are only one sprite, so they're really easy to install while still being functional.

Below, I have instructions for two ways to install Firefly apps.

```

# To paste link:

Right-click (Windows), two-finger-click (Universal), alt-click (ChromeOS) or ctrl-click (macOS) the Raw button
